                         <h3>Exploring the Data</h3>
                         <h4>Writing Queries</h4>
                         <p>For increased flexibility, this app allows you to define your own variables. Often times it makes more sense to map proportions than counts. In this example, we'll proportionalize rates of poverty. To build a query, it simply must follow this format. <New Variable Name> = <Mathematical Expression> </p>
                         <h4>Color Scales</h4>
                         <p>This App currently supports the Viridis and ColorBrewer palettes. For those who aren't familiar, both Viridis and COlorBrewer palettes were designed with accessibiliy in mind. BOth are designed to be color-blind accessible.</p>

                         <p>This is a small project that I began to simplify the process of making maps in R. That is also why this entire application is made using R Shiny.</p>
